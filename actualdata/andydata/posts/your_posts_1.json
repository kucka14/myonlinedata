This year, on August 20, there will be a CF fundraising bicycle race in Ann Arbor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Michigan CF Cycle for Life. \n\nCF is a genetic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. There is currently a medley of treatments that target the symptoms of the disease, but there is no definitive treatment or cure. All people with CF face great uncertainty. \n\nChrista, more than some, benefits from the drugs that are available. She herself will be riding in the Michigan Cycle for Life this August (and beating many of us), which not only speaks to her unassailable enthusiasm, but also demonstrates the potential of CF drug research. \n\nBecause Christa is a compassionate friend, compulsive volunteer, and future physician, the number of people she will help, serve, and heal over her lifetime will inevitably exceed the number of benefactors she will have. If you would like to seize this rare chance to help a person who has devoted herself to helping others, you can donate to any of the riders on our Cycle for Life team \u00e2\u0080\u0093 @[1102847763105061:274:Team Sweat Quest]. Your donation will (to Christa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great relief) benefit not just her, but all CF patients; proceeds go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
