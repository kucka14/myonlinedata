I just emailed a bunch of people at CMI, and even though many of the emails didn't even go through, I eventually got offered the marine biology job. And then when I was trying to find out what the job would actually consist of, I kept getting referred to different people, until someone emailed me that I should 'just contact Stanley - he's in charge of everything.' And it was Stanley Lorennij. So I'll have the same boss as before, although I don't think he has much to do with the marine bio class. And I'll be living with Grandy. It should be fun.",
