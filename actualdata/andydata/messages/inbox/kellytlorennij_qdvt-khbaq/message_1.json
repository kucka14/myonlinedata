I write poems from time to time and a while back I wrote one about the nuclear testing in the RMI. I sometimes read it in writing groups, but I feel guilty because in the poem I'm talking about Marshallese things like I know them and I really don't. For instance, I use a word for god that I've seen in the Marshallese-English dictionary, but I've never actually heard someone say it. I'd be curious what you think. And if you think there's something problematic about the poem, I'll stop reading it. I'm asking you because you're a writer, but if you don't have time, no problem. Take care!",
