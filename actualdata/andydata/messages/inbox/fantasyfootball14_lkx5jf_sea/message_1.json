      "content": "Hello All,There are a few things that are different about this year's league.  First of which is the website that we are now using.  Due to the suggestions of some of the members, I have decided to switch from ESPN to nfl.com.  We have a different setup, but the scoring system is still the same as last years for the most part, with the exception of a couple of changes. (More on that later)\n\nSecondly, I have made a couple of adjustments to the league rosters.  First off, I have added another flex spot to the starting lineup.  This means that there are now 10 positions in the starting lineup as opposed to the 9 that we had last year.  The reason for this change is that I thought it would be more fun to have higher scoring games.  Haha.  For those of you who are not familiar with a flex spot or either don't remember, it is an extra position that can be used on a running back, wide receiver, or tight end.  Secondly, I have shortened up the bench from 7 players to 5 players, due to suggestions from some of the members last year.  This way the draft won't be quite as long, and there will be more to choose from on waivers.\n\nThirdly, I have made a couple of changes to the scoring system.  The first change is that we are now doing a half-PPR format.  This means that .5 points will be awarded to a team every time one of its players makes a reception.  The second change is that we are now using a decimal based scoring system as opposed to a standard scoring system.  For example, 67 passing, rushing, or receiving yards will be accounted for as 6.7 points instead of just 6 points.\n\nThe buy in is the same as last year, which is $10.  Get the money to me whenever you can, but preferably before the end of the season.  Haha.  It can be by person or by mail, and I take either cash, check, or money order. (Just for you, Mario.  Haha) My mailing address is as follows:\n\n3069 Valley Ridge Ct.\n\nHudsonville, MI 49426\n\nFor the pot ($100), I was thinking $60 could go to first place, $25 to second place, and $15 to third place.\n\nAs far as the draft is concerned, I am aiming for an online draft sometime this Friday night (29th), but am willing to change the date to accommodate as many league members as possible.  If anyone has a date or time that they think would work, please let me know!",
