My sister got diagnosed with CF last year; she and the rest of us felt compelled to do something, so we started a fundraising team. If you want, you can give money to one of the bicycle riders on our team (it doesn't really matter who because all the money goes to the same place anyway). Or you could sign up to ride; it should be fun. It happens to be in Ann Arbor this year. Here's the website, if you're interested: http://fightcf.cff.org/goto/teamsweatquest",
