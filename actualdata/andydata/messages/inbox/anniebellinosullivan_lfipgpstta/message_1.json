My family and I are just west of GR and we love it :) I was actually hoping you could help me out. I wanted to do some networking for a project I'm working on. I know you know good ppl and I wanted to see if you know anyone who might be a good fit if I describe what I'm looking for. Would you be free in the next few days for a quick phone call? I'd really appreciate it. Hope all is well!  \r\n\r\nAnnie (Bellino) Sullivan\r\n734-770-9222",
