I am an American who will be in the Marshall Islands from the middle of June until the end of July this year. 3 years ago I spent a year teaching at Laura High School. I was wondering if there is any paid or volunteer work that might be available during that time. I have a little medical experience. I do not speak very good Marshallese, but I will be working on it before I come. Let me know. Thanks!",
