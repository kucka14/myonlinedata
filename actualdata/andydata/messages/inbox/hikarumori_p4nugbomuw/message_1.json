I asked Rina ( the other Japanese) if she is available on this Saturday. But she can't make it because she will be in Chicago from Friday night to Sunday. She also wants to have lunch together, so is there another available days for you?? Because it's thanksgiving break, we both are not on Campus from 19th to 27th. Sorry. I hope we can figure out what date would work.",
