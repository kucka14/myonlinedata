I was hoping to get them one large gift and maybe a couple of smaller things that they can open when we're all \"together.\" I also plan to get a cake or edible arrangement delivered in time for the shower as well. What days will everyone be at the lake? I was thinking either Wednesday or Thursday evening might be good, if you all are going to be there (Emily I know you won't be there in any case--want us to skype you in?) Let me know so I can schedule with Ben and Betsy! Also, if you'd like to contribute to a gift please just drop me a note to say how much so I don't over or underspend! Looking forward to seeing you!",
