When you get the scores, you should talk to David Utter and Tata about them. Tata took the test, and David knows a lot about the test. It would be good to know how you did, especially if you decide to take the test again next year. Anyway, take care. Enjoy the rest of your summer.",

Thanks for ur help on the SAT and for some advises..I didnt  get to tell u about the test. Well, we were the first one to be and majority of other students were from private school and I can say the test was pretty hard but at least I try. Yeah u were right, some of the student just gave up and their heads was their tables. Yeah it was my first SAT and I am proud I was able to experience that. Honestly, at first, I sometimes lost hope that I might have a bad result on that but u gave me that hope. U encourage me, never got tired of coming over my house and spent time on practice. I learned a lot from those practices and I remembered some of ur advice during the test..thank u for everything and have a great summer.",
